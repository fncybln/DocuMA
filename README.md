# DocuMA

Documa is an app which aims to make the documentation process in Theater contexts easier, especially with Preset-heavy shows.

When usable (which is very much istn yet) can read out GrandMa Preset export .xml files and lets you take photos for each device in each preset.
I have no idea of what i am doing here lmfao :)
